\section{Justification Statement}

% % % The justification statement briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. 

Social Friction in Online Communities is a \textbf{regular submission} for NSPW 2020. In the paper, we question current dogma regarding the fundamental qualities of the internet and analyze the ways those attitudes have affected security research and the design of online communities. We present a new concept, \textit{social friction}, and explore its implications for the design of online communities. Since this paper critiques existing approaches to security and presents a new approach, we feel that it is  appropriate for submission to NSPW in the ``regular submission'' category.
